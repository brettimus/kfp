-KILL-
-FUCK-
-PRESIDENT-

The Game: You get 3 names—you must choose which you would KILL, which you would FUCK, and which you would make The LEADER of the FREE WORLD. 

For example: 

Justin Bieber   -   Miley Cyrus   -   Paula Dean

KILL
There’s only one choice. It’s Bieber. Boy’s gotta die. But he’s Canadian so really you should feel no qualms.

FUCK
Yes, yes, I know you want to fuck Miley Cyrus. But you CANNOT let Paula be President! She’ll bring back black and white water fountains—but the water fountains will be liquid butter.  So, sorry, you’re stuck playing hide the sausage with Paula—just make sure you pre-heat the oven: things are gonna get hot.

PRESIDENT
So Miley is the president! The national bird is now a tongue! It’s a party in the USA.

ONLINE FORMATTING EXAMPLE:

Would adjust the formatting so that each bunch is more condensed, but still have the ability to pick who you would “K, F, or P” and reveal the “correct” answer.
